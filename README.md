# Python-Vector-Operations

This is a set of functions that can perform vector algebra, dot products, and cross products, and calculate the length of a vector projected onto another.

"Functions.py" is the list of functions I have made and is the framework on which "User_Interface.py" is built.
It is formatted so that running a function prompts the user to input the necessary information and then returns whatever the output is (either a vector or a scalar).

"Functions.py" is built to work by itself or in conjunction with "User_Interface.py," which is designed to be a way to navigate and use the functions easily.
